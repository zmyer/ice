      IceBinPath:

        This variable points to the Ice binary directory used by the current
        build, it depends on the Platform and Configuration of the project.

      IceLibraryPath:

        This variable points to the Ice library directory used by the current
        build, it depends on the Platform and Configuration of the project.

      IceIncludePath:

        This variable contains the Ice header search path for the current build,
        for source builds that depends on the Platform, Configuration and Cpp
        mapping being used.

      IceToolsPath:

        This variable points to the directory containing the Slice compilers used
        by the current build.
