# Building Ice for Python on Linux and OS X

This page describes how to build and install Ice for Python from source code on
Linux and OS X. If you prefer, you can also download [binary distributions][1]
for the supported platforms.

## Python Build Requirements

### Operating Systems and Compilers

Ice for Python is expected to build and run properly on OS X and any recent
Linux distribution for x86 and x86_64, and was extensively tested using the
operating systems and compiler versions listed for our [supported platforms][2].

### Python Versions

Ice for Python supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, and 3.5. Note however that
your Python installation must have been built with a C++ compiler that is
compatible with the one used to build Ice for C++.

## Building the Python Extension

The build of Ice for Python requires to first build Ice for C++ in the `cpp`
subdirectory.

Edit `config/Make.rules` to establish your build configuration. The comments in
the file provide more information.

Change to the Ice for Python source subdirectory:

    $ cd python

Execute `python -V` to verify that the correct Python interpreter is in your
executable search path.

Run `make` to build the extension.

Upon successful completion, run `make install`. You may need additional user
privileges to install in the directory specified by `config/Make.rules`.

## Configuring your Environment for Python

Modify your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the Ice extension
for Python. For example, assuming you installed the extension in the directory
`/opt/Ice`, you would modify your environment as shown below:

    $ export PYTHONPATH=/opt/Ice/python:$PYTHONPATH

## Running the Python Tests

After a successful build, you can run the tests as follows:

    $ python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of `ok` messages. In case of a
failure, the tests abort with `failed`.
